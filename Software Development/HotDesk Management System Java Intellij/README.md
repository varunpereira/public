Course: Further Programming, COSC2391

1. Run Program: Compile and Run from main method in Main class in main.appsetup, using Intellij. 
Nothing additional to do.

2. Read 'Contents Document': Lists Tasks Achieved (in regards to rubric and criteria), design changes, lessons learnt.

# Packaging
The main class is Main.java in package main.appsetup.

Packaging for other classes:
 - main.controller
 - main.model
 - main.view
Within each are subfolders for different user account types (admin, employee, shared).

Contents of Program:
- hotedesking desktop java application.
- users might have trouble navigating throughout all pages however this can be overcome with practice.
- some bugs could exist but very minor. Note, FXML warning is uncontrollable, as whenever I fix version it reverts back to default automatically.
- in future I would add more functionality and more sophisticated design, that caters better to its users.
